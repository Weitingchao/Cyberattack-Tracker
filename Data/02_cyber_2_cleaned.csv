The threat actors also went after John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and released more embarrassing data throughout the summer.

The secretary of homeland security and the director of national intelligence released a joint statement asserting that the protracted cyber espionage campaign was the work of Russian actors. The Barack Obama administration subsequently sanctioned Russian intelligence officials and deported suspected officers working in the United States.

Google was the only company that confirmed it was a victim and disclosed to the public that the Gmail accounts of certain Chinese human rights activists had been compromised. Google also publicly attributed the incident to China, something companies were reluctant to do for fear of jeopardizing their access to the Chinese market.  

The incident is viewed as a milestone in the recent history of cyber operations because it raised the profile of cyber operations as a tool for industrial espionage. It led Google to cease its operations in China, though it continues to operate a localized version of its search engine in Hong Kong. As a result of the Gmail compromise, Google began notifying users if it believed their accounts had been targeted or compromised by a state-sponsored actor. This practice later spread to other email providers.","Denouncement   http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/asia/22diplo.html","Google, Adobe, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northtrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical","China","Espionage","Private sector","Denouncement ","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/asia/22diplo.html  ",FALSE,"Super Power","2010-01-14",2010

Stuxnet was specifically designed to cause centrifuges to fail while providing readings to their operators that they were running normally. Reports indicate that the United States pursued the Stuxnet operation as a way of degrading Iran’s nuclear weapons program without resorting to an airstrike or an attack by special operation forces.

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when “somebody crossed the Rubicon.” However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.","Denouncement   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417","Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, United States, Uzbekistan, Russia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan","Israel, United States","Sabotage","Military","Denouncement ","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417  ",TRUE,"Super Power","2010-07-22",2010
